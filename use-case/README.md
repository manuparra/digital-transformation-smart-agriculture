# My use case

Choose a scenario and your use case.

As a first step choose a product, service, project, etc. to write the reviews about. 
Below, when we write ‘product’, also services and features are included. You will have more impact if teams discuss their own product, but they can also choose a scenario not related to their current work. In any case, teams can explore real-world implications of the application or technology they are developing.

**Examples of a product scenario**

- ‘GPS and temperature sensor to tracking during wine transport’
- ‘Drone images to identify crop disease’
- ‘AI analytics to do yield prediction of crops’
- ‘Diseases forecating in tomatoes‘
- ‘Smart irrigation in orange production fields.‘
- ‘Reducing culling in broiler farms - Optimising the weight of birds in the growing cycle.‘

**Describe your use case**

- Name: Include a short name and a long number that describes your use case well. 
For example: *SMART4TOMATOES* - *Applying intelligent techniques for tomato production volume prediction*.

- Description: Describe in more detail what your use case is about, including: 
  - A Context (area, region, crop, ...)
  - The problem and its consequences on the project/service ....
  - The objectives you want to achieve.
  - And the impact of the objectives (for different areas: social environment, company, region, economic impact, quality, value chain, ...).
  - The Stakeholders ( if you know). 
  - Financial needs.
  - Technologies you know that you could apply (don't worry if you don't know many).
  - Whether the project or use case is ongoing, the current level of technification (from 1 to 10).
