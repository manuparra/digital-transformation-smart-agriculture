## Enterprise 4.0 / Industry 4.0

Evolution through the most advanced technological innovations to become a 'smart enterprise':

> Activity **1**
> **Aim:** Discussion - ICT and Business Intelligence.

**About Industry 4.0**

It is not only an additional step at the software or hardware level, it is also a change in the corporate mindset to adopt disruptive technologies.
It integrates everything: organisation, people and assets.

It involves the emergence of technologies: Robotics, AI, cognitive technology, IoT, Nanotechnology, etc., but you need to select criteria to decide whether or not they meet your needs.

Non-adoption is likely to mean loss of market, performance and competitive position.

**What is the importance of Enterprise 4.0?**


- It affects all areas of business.
 - Not integrating in some way, in part or in full, takes you away from the general trend of implementing the 4.0 model: 
   - [With exceptions]
   - With consequences]


- Who doesn't want to optimise their processes, improve a product, or be more profitable?
    [All: at what cost?]

- Changes in human resources:
  - New roles, new skills  and culture of change
  - More technology does not mean  less human resources


**Impact of Enterprise 4.0**

The impact occurs at several levels:

Ecosystem
- Incentivises change in ecosystem around the product/company:
  - Suppliers, Customers, Investors, ...

Organisations:
  - Internal adjustment. Learning from real-time data for example can result in more proactive and predictive companies.

Individuals
  - Employees: retraining/adaptation and improved work efficiency. Greater control.
- Customers: product customisation. Product satisfaction.

**Example of the impact on our business**
