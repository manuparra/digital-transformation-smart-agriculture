## Enterprise 4.0 / Industry 4.0

Evolution through the most advanced technological innovations to become a 'smart enterprise':

> Activity **1**
> **Aim:** Discussion - ICT and Business Intelligence.

**About Industry 4.0**

It is not only an additional step at the software or hardware level, it is also a change in the corporate mindset to adopt disruptive technologies.
It integrates everything: organisation, people and assets.

It involves the emergence of technologies: Robotics, AI, cognitive technology, IoT, Nanotechnology, etc., but you need to select criteria to decide whether or not they meet your needs.

Non-adoption is likely to mean loss of market, performance and competitive position.

**What is the importance of Enterprise 4.0?**


- It affects all areas of business.
 - Not integrating in some way, in part or in full, takes you away from the general trend of implementing the 4.0 model: 
   - [With exceptions]
   - With consequences]


- Who doesn't want to optimise their processes, improve a product, or be more profitable?
    [All: at what cost?]

- Changes in human resources:
  - New roles, new skills  and culture of change
  - More technology does not mean  less human resources


**Impact of Enterprise 4.0**

The impact occurs at several levels:

Ecosystem
- Incentivises change in ecosystem around the product/company:
  - Suppliers, Customers, Investors, ...

Organisations:
  - Internal adjustment. Learning from real-time data for example can result in more proactive and predictive companies.

Individuals
  - Employees: retraining/adaptation and improved work efficiency. Greater control.
- Customers: product customisation. Product satisfaction.

**Example of the impact on our business**

Ecosystem:
- Knowing with minimal error the production, improves the product and the relationship with consumers. 

Organisations:
- Drags other processes or areas to innovate and improve.
  
Individuals:
- Employees and customers.

## Why do R&I + Industry 4.0 on agricultural and rural digital transformation matter?
  
Digital technologies have the potential to revolutionise agriculture by helping farmers work more precisely, efficiently and sustainably. 
  
Data-driven insights can improve decision-making and practices and help increase environmental performance while making the job more attractive to **younger generations**.
    
Digital technologies also have the potential to offer consumers greater transparency as to how their food is produced. 
  
They offer oppor tunities to renew business models in value chains by connecting producers and consumers in innovative ways.
  
Beyond farming, digital technologies are key:
- to make rural communities more attractive, smart and sustainable, 
- reducing problems related to remoteness and improving access to services. 
  
Research and innovation are vitally important to facilitate and accelerate digital transformation in agriculture and rural areas for the benefit of citizens and businesses.

## SMART objectives

The SMART framework allows you to set realistic and measurable goals your team can achieve in 2022 and beyond. SMART is an acronym with each letter giving you a mindset for setting goals:

S (Specific) - Keep your goals very specific and narrow so that it's clear what you're trying to achieve

M (Measurable) - Establish metrics to ensure you are on track to hit your goals

A (Attainable) - Your team should be able to achieve this goal within a reasonable timeframe (one month, one quarter)

R (Relevant) - Your team goals should align with your organization's strategic and business objectives

T (Time-based) - There should be a specific end date for your goals so that your team can create a work plan and prioritize tasks leading up to the end date

> Example of a non-SMART goal: We will keep our company's website up to date.

> Example of a SMART goal: During our Monday morning 9 a.m. team meeting, get updates from the team on what assets they want to update on the website, and publish the changes by Tuesday 9 a.m. After every update, send changes to the broader company so they are up to date on what's new on the website.

**Goals**
  
- Re-write objectives into goals, and for each goal: 
  - How is it specific?
  - How is measurable?
  - How is it attainable?
  - How is it relevant?
  - How is it time-based?
  
## SWOT  
  
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Use this template to think about your business and competition from a fresh perspective. SWOT analysis helps you assess strengths and weaknesses, and how you can leverage those qualities to respond to market opportunities and threats.

**Internal factors**
  
- Strengths -  List factors that put your business at a competitive advantage.
- Weaknesses - List factors that put your business at a competitive advantage.

  
**External factors**
