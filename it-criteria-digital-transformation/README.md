**Rethinking**
- Rapid development of new digital technologies:
- Businesses forced to rethink ICT.
- Redesign of models and processes or lose momentum.
- Practically impossible to keep up with all technologies. 

**Result**

  - Economy and Society
  - Need to understand change to be able to decide what opportunities and challenges exist for our area, in particular the Agriculture sector.


**Understanding the ICT spectrum will help to digitally transform the company and make decisions to adapt to change.**


The rise of [computer] technology in recent decades:
- It has led to changes in the interaction both of humans with computers and between humans and computers,  and contextualises how individuals, businesses and government have been adapting to these changes.

## Enterprise 4.0 / Industry 4.0

Evolution through the most advanced technological innovations to become a 'smart enterprise':

> Activity **1**
> **Aim:** Discussion - ICT and Business Intelligence.

**About Industry 4.0**

It is not only an additional step at the software or hardware level, it is also a change in the corporate mindset to adopt disruptive technologies.
It integrates everything: organisation, people and assets.

It involves the emergence of technologies: Robotics, AI, cognitive technology, IoT, Nanotechnology, etc., but you need to select criteria to decide whether or not they meet your needs.

Non-adoption is likely to mean loss of market, performance and competitive position.

**What is the importance of Enterprise 4.0?**


- It affects all areas of business.
 - Not integrating in some way, in part or in full, takes you away from the general trend of implementing the 4.0 model: 
   - [With exceptions]
   - With consequences]


- Who doesn't want to optimise their processes, improve a product, or be more profitable?
    [All: at what cost?]

- Changes in human resources:
  - New roles, new skills  and culture of change
  - More technology does not mean  less human resources


**Impact of Enterprise 4.0**

The impact occurs at several levels:

Ecosystem
- Incentivises change in ecosystem around the product/company:
  - Suppliers, Customers, Investors, ...

Organisations:
  - Internal adjustment. Learning from real-time data for example can result in more proactive and predictive companies.

Individuals
  - Employees: retraining/adaptation and improved work efficiency. Greater control.
- Customers: product customisation. Product satisfaction.

**Example of the impact on our business**

Ecosystem:
- Knowing with minimal error the production, improves the product and the relationship with consumers. 

Organisations:
- Drags other processes or areas to innovate and improve.
  
Individuals:
- Employees and customers.

## Why do R&I + Industry 4.0 on agricultural and rural digital transformation matter?
  
Digital technologies have the potential to revolutionise agriculture by helping farmers work more precisely, efficiently and sustainably. 
  
Data-driven insights can improve decision-making and practices and help increase environmental performance while making the job more attractive to **younger generations**.
    
Digital technologies also have the potential to offer consumers greater transparency as to how their food is produced. 
  
They offer oppor tunities to renew business models in value chains by connecting producers and consumers in innovative ways.
  
Beyond farming, digital technologies are key:
- to make rural communities more attractive, smart and sustainable, 
- reducing problems related to remoteness and improving access to services. 
  
Research and innovation are vitally important to facilitate and accelerate digital transformation in agriculture and rural areas for the benefit of citizens and businesses.
